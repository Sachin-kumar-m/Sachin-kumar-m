<h1>Hi there I'am Sachin Kumar 👋</h1>

## About Me
👋 Passionate developer on a journey through the digital wilderness. I, personally, believe coding is not just about commands and algorithms; it's the art of crafting solutions and the magic of turning ideas into reality. 🤷


<h2>💻 Tech Stack, I've worked with 🧰</h2>
<br>
<li>Frontend: ReactJS, Web Technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS</li>
<br>
<li>Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Django</li>
<br>
<li>Databases: MongoDB, MySQL</li>
<br><br>
<h2>Fun Facts 🤯</h2>
<li>My code is so DRY it needs sunscreen. 🏖️</li>
<li>My code is like a fine wine; it takes years to mature (or at least until it compiles without errors). 🍷👨‍💻</li>
<li>I don't make mistakes in my code; I create unpredictable features. 🤪👨‍💻</li>

<li>I believe that the best code is written at 3 AM while eating pizza🍕</li>
